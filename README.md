# P&S-ARK

Packet Switched - Acting Kybernetic Reality

# Statements

Following statements are intended to hold true for this repository

## 1. P&S-ARK is a TEMPLATE Project

P&S-ARK is not a "real" project, but it is currently used to publish my opinion
about a project / or about projects / that should be conducted by "some
celestial community" to elaborate the "Celestial Requirements" for the NSN and
to use the NSN, after it will have been standardized

So, actually this means, I (we) will do experiments, we will test this or that
software, but we will implement our own software only, if this is needed to
test something else.

The current repository is the place for such experiments and/or tests and/or
testing software.

## 2. The GOALs of this project can be described as follows

- The Publication of the Idea "Mixed Reality Group Call" by a GPL
- Further goals to be defined
