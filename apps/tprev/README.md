# The Teapot Review

The Teapot Review is an X3D Multiuser Scene, which is currently based on the
DIS protocol.

I was using this scene to test the FreeWrl DIS implementation, in the course of
my project
[Experiments with FreeWrl and DIS over the TVI](https://lc-soc-lc.or.at/project-003-dexper/index.html).

That project was not actually connected to the P&S-ARK project, but I decided to
store the "Teapot Review" here at the psark repository, in order to be able to
collaborate with other authors.

That project has already been closed (abandoned).
